  "content": "**The journey begins** — Hello, world! First of all, I would like to state that this blog post is the first of many, hopefully!\n\n<br>After a long time of procrast— I mean planning, I have finally managed to create a blog. My own platform where I'm planning on sharing my dev journey; a diary if you will. Of course I didn't make this blog out of FOMO or to ease my way to get a job or anything...*cough*\n\n<br>Real talk, I'm grateful to have finished this blog. Not only that it made me productive, it tested my knowledge regarding front-end development. Additionally, it helped me learn alot of new things, especially how back-end code works. I have managed to learn Go and Gin in a short amount of time and created this blog on my own. An achievement on its own, in my opinion.\n\n<br>Regardless, I would like to invite you all to try making a blog on your own. I would encourage you to try writing, be it your thoughts, an experience you had, or a billion dollar idea. It's fun and relaxing in some way. Enough of me though, thank you all for reading!\n\n<br>Now, a snippet of code using the language that made this blog possible.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello, World!\")\n}\n```",
